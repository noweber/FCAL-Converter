			Division of Work Statement
Design:
	Token Class:	Jointly designed this class during lecture exercises.  The constructor was designed
			at the start of iteration 1 together.
	
	Scanner Class:	Jointly designed this class.  Both members helped design tokenListFromString()
			which does the bulk of the work helping scan().
		
			Jointly designed scan() helper functions appendTokenLists(), init(), getEnum(),
			getStringLength(), nCharCopy(), and the class constructor.
	
			The consumeWhiteSpacesAndComments() function was takent from WordCount.cpp (lab_03)

	Testing:
			The tests for both classes constructors and helpers were jointly designed.  Both
			members designed the terminal tests.
		
			Amy designed the additional necessary regular expressions.

Implementation:
	Token Class:	Amy wrote the Token class along with its fields and constructors.

	Scanner Class:	Nicholas wrote Scanner::scan(), helper functions tokenListFromString(),
			appendTokenLists(), getStringLength(), nCharCopy(), and its constructor.
			Amy assisted in debugging after base code was established.
 
			Amy wrote the scan() helper functions init() and getEnum()
	
	Testing:	Amy wrote the base regular expressions and terminal tests.  

			Nicholas wrote scan() helper function base tests.
			
			Other testing was written jointly.  Both members wrote some tests for each of the scan() helper
			functions generally with both members at the same computer.  Both members contributing in adding
			terminal tests until all 40 had been completed once the test format had been implemented.
