					ITERATION 4 WORK STATEMENT
=============================================================================================================
AST.CPP
	Jointly went through unparse() functions and implemented them to fit the test cases for iteration 3.

	Jointly wrote a few of the cppCode() functions.
	
	While Nicholas was creating the Matrix.cpp file, Amy was working on the remaining cppCode() functions in order
	to pass the codegeneration_tests. Amy wrote most of the cppCode() functions with debug assistant from Nicholas.
		
	Nicholas adjusted cppCode() to properly match test_sample_6 and attempted to fix test_forest_loss_v2 after Matrix.cpp
	was fully implemented.
	
	Amy ensured test_sample_1 through test_sample_8 passed, debugging any issues that arrived in the process.
	
PARSER.CPP
	Nicholas altered the Parser.cpp file in order to create the AST. 
	
MATRIX.CPP
	Nicholas created the Matrix.cpp file.  
	
	Jointly designed how the Matrix.cpp methods would be defined including two additional helper functions.
	
	Nicholas wrote the Matrix.cpp method definitions, with debugging assistance from Amy.
	
ITERATION 3 BUG FIXES
	Jointly added printf statements in order to locate the bug that was causing a segmentation fault.  (The segmentation
	fault was not delivered with iteration 3 as it was commented out, but not yet pin-pointed) We discovered that the 
	bug had to do with an incorrect dynamic_cast to a StdDecl instead of to a Decl. We used the printf statements as 
	error checking in our unparse() functions to see what was not being created correctly.
	
DELIVERY
	Jointly checked that all necessary files were in the correct locations.
	
	Nicholas emailed csci3081-help@cs.umn.edu at approximately 2000 on 20141211 to request iteration 3 test case regrading.
	
	Nicholas created the iter4 tag and pushed.
